ChessMatch -> Screen -> ChessPosition -> ChessPiece -> MovePiece -> GameOver




The game starts and an instance of ChessMatch is created.

PrintMatch method of Screen class is called to display the initial state of the board, 
captured pieces, turn, and player waiting to play.

The user is prompted to input the source and destination positions of the piece they want to move. 

The input is read by the program and parsed into ChessPosition objects.

The ChessMatch instance checks if the move is valid using the IsValidMove method of ChessPiece class. 
If the move is invalid, the user is prompted to input a new move. 
If the move is valid, the move is executed using the MovePiece method of ChessMatch class.


After the move is executed, the ChessMatch instance checks if the move resulted in a 
"check" or "checkmate" situation. If it did, the GameOver property of ChessMatch is set to true and the game ends.

Otherwise, the turn is switched to the other player and the game continues from step 2.








Note that this is a very simplified sequence and there are likely many more steps involved in the full implementation of a Chess Game.
Additionally, this sequence only covers the user input and the movement of the pieces,
and doesn't cover things like game setup, piece capture, en passant moves, castling,
promotions, and many other important aspects of a Chess Game.
